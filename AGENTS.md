# AGENTS

## Code style
- Keep React and Next.js components concise and prefer utility functions over repeating logic.
- Surface meaningful fallbacks instead of throwing unhandled errors in server components and API routes.

## Testing
- After changing application code or documentation, run `npm run build` to ensure the project still compiles.
